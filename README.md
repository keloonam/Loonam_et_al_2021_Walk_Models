I know this repository is empty. I'm not sure how it happened, but I am working on updating it. I have a version of the code
recovered from an old machine that I can sned if you message me. 

When I get that version updated to reflect the published methods, I will update this repository.

# Walk-Models
Holds random walk models and modified random walk models for simulating camera trapping efforts and abundance estimation methods.

Constains simulations of animals moving across a landscape:
- Radnomly
- With respect to patchy habitat
- With respect to territories
- While undergoing removal

Detections of each simulated walk are recorded at a gird of cameras and stored as 1/0 capture histories that abundance estimation methods, such as time-to-event are applied to
